# Squigley
Squigley is a game that I started developing during my freshman year of college when I barely knew how to program. As such, expect a lot of what you see to be complete dogshit code. I did want to backup this project to github so that I never lose it though, as I've learned a lot during this project and had many successes along with my pitfalls.

If you're looking for quality code, here's some places you might expect to find something decent that is entirely mine:
* Assets/Scripts/Bosses/Theos/AttackManager.cs or anything else in that folder.
* Assets/Scripts/Logic/DebugTerminal.cs
* Assets/Message Scripting/NewMessageHandler.cs
  * This is obviously "new" because it reworked an old, shittier system. It's still not perfect, but I made it all on my own when some of the big programming concepts finally started clicking.

If you're reading this, the game should already be free on steam by now.
